## Execution Plan
> Note: This is an auto-generated execution plan, you can take it as a reference. It's READONLY and you can NOT modify it.

1. Perform the initial code modifications using tool #upgrade_java_project_using_openrewrite, but this is usually not enough.
    * You will need to perform the version upgrades for Java and dependencies by yourself if OpenRewrite fails to do so.
2. Check for any build errors using tool #build_java_project and fix the reported errors using any available tools.
    * NOTE: You MUST! repeat this step until the project builds successfully.
3. Check for any other issue (e.g. CVE issues, code behavior changes and test failures) and fix them. NOTE: You MUST! invoke tool #build_java_project to validate the code changes after each fix.
    1. Check for any CVE issues using tool #validate_cves_for_java and fix the **Critical**, **High** and **Medium** severity ones.
    2. Check for invalid code behavioral changes using tool #validate_behavior_changes_for_java and fix the **Critical** and **Major** severity ones.
    3. Check for any test errors/failures using tool #run_tests_for_java and fix those related to this upgrade.
4. You may repeat step 3 for several attempts until the project builds successfully and all issues are fixed.
5. Finally, Remember to summarize all the changes made during this upgrading process using tool #summarize_upgrade after the process is complete, no matter if the project builds successfully or not.
